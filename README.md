🌦️ Dynamic Weather App with Custom Backgrounds 🌍
This project is a Weather App that fetches real-time weather data 🌡️ from the OpenWeatherMap API for any city around the globe. To make the experience more engaging, the app dynamically loads a background image 🖼️ based on the city name using the Unsplash API. If no image is found, a default image is used, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Initially, the project focused on providing basic weather information like temperature 🌡️, humidity 💧, and wind speed 🌬️. Over time, it evolved to include dynamic background images that personalize each user's weather experience, making it more immersive and visually appealing.
