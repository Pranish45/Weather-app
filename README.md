## 🌦️ Dynamic Weather App with Custom Backgrounds 🌍
This project is a Weather App that fetches real-time weather data 🌡️ from the OpenWeatherMap API for any city around the globe. To make the experience more engaging, the app dynamically loads a background image 🖼️ based on the city name using the Unsplash API. If no image is found, a default image is used, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Initially, the project focused on providing basic weather information like temperature 🌡️, humidity 💧, and wind speed 🌬️. Over time, it evolved to include dynamic background images that personalize each user's weather experience, making it more immersive and visually appealing.

## 🚀 Key Features:
• Real-time weather updates 🌞 from OpenWeatherMap.
• Dynamic background images 🏙️ based on the city name using the Unsplash API.
• Fallback mechanism 🔄 to default images when no relevant background is found.
• User-friendly interface 💻 powered by Streamlit.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used:
• Streamlit for building the app's interface.
• OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
• Unsplash API for fetching city-based background images.
• Requests for making API calls and handling responses.
